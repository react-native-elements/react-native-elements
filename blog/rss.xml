I have learned a lot from the community, especially how to organize commits and write readable code. <strong>React Native Elements</strong> is an amazing community to work with, as mentors are really helpful and experienced. I had started contributing to React Native Elements from March 2021 and till now, I have 40+ commits (10,803 additions and 13,826 deletions) merged. Over the past few months, I had great exposure writing maintainable code, communicating with the mentors, etc. I had completed some of my work in the coding period started as some issues mentioned in my proposal had a high priority for the release.</p><div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arpitBhalla/google-summer-of-code/master/assets//contri.png" width="900"/></div><h2>🚘 Work Abstract</h2><h3>Refactor components to use <code>Pressable</code> API <a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/3170">(#3170)</a></h3><blockquote><p><code>Pressable</code> is preferred to <code>Touchable</code> components according to React Native official docs. <code>Pressable</code> component offers a more extensive and future-proof way of handling the touch-based inputs.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><code>Touchable</code> Component:</p><ul><li>It includes the styles and effects that do not meet the platform interactions.</li><li>It does not support high-quality interaction experience on different platforms.</li></ul></li><li><p><code>Pressable</code> Component:</p><ul><li>It detects various types of interactions.</li><li>Its API provides direct access to the current state of interaction.</li><li>Its capabilities could be extended to include hover, blur, focus, and more.
<code>Pressable</code> contains a lot of new props and cool features such as:
delayLongPress: Duration in milliseconds from onPressIn by the time onLongPress is called.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Reference : <a href="https://medium.com/@mahyarmohammadi/react-native-pressable-vs-touchable-5fec6b332f15">Pressable vs. Touchable in React Native</a></p><h3>Migrate Tests to React Native Testing Library <a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/3170">(#3170)</a></h3><blockquote><p>Rather than tests focusing on the implementation (Enzyme), tests are more focused on user behavior (react-native-testing-library).</p></blockquote><p>Enzyme allows us to access the internal workings of your components. You can read and set the state, and we can mock children to make tests run faster. On the other hand, RN testing-library doesn&#x27;t give us any access to the implementation details. It renders the components and provides utility methods to interact with them. The idea is that you should communicate with our application in the same way a user would. So rather than set the state of a component we reproduce the actions a user would do to reach that state.</p><h3>Class to Functions Migration</h3><p>Some components like <strong>Image, ToolTip</strong> which further include SearchBar android &amp; SearchBar iOS were Class Components and the code was messy, These are migrated to Functional Components and added hooks like, useState, useEffect, useCallBack, which would increase performance.</p><ul><li><strong>Using classes</strong> - We need to describe lifecycle methods, state of the component, component’s methods that will change our state or work with the store. Also, we need to bind all the methods for the component instance. The component becomes large, and it becomes more difficult to read each time.</li><li><strong>Using hooks</strong> - We can get the state of the component so that it can be easily tested and reused. Now we can facilitate the exchange of links between components or our entire application - using hooks. Hooks allow you to encapsulate logic without affecting the hierarchy of components.</li></ul><h2>🎊 My Contributions</h2><p>You can find all my contributions <a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AarpitBhalla+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Amerged">here</a></p><h3>New components</h3><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2867">LinearProgress (#2867)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2885">FAB (#2885)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2896">Speed dial (#2896)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2919">Tab &amp; TabItem (#2919)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements-universe/pull/1">CircularSlider (#1)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2983">TabView &amp; TabView.Item (#2983)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2953">ListItem Accordion (#2953)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2982">ListItem Swipeable (#2982)</a></li></ul><h3>Core Improvements</h3><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/3101">Migrate build to Github Actions (#3101)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2930">Strict TypeScript (#2930)</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/2834">Removed ts-ignore and transformed to Functional Component (#2834)</a></li></ul><h3>Documentation redesigned <a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements/react-native-elements/pull/3108">(#3108)</a></h3><div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arpitBhalla/google-summer-of-code/master/assets//website.png"/></div><h3>Snack player</h3><p>It helps user to test the component from documentation</p><div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arpitBhalla/google-summer-of-code/master/assets//snack.png"/></div><h3>VS Code extension</h3><p>Auto imports components and auto complete syntax with component preview for React Native Elements.</p><div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arpitBhalla/google-summer-of-code/master/assets//vscode.png"/></div><h2>🚧 What&#x27;s next?</h2><h3>New <code>Stack</code> Component</h3><p>Stack is concerned with one-dimensional layouts. <code>This is not yet in the priority</code> but it would help developers.</p><p>Example</p><pre><code class="language-js">&lt;Stack spacing={2}&gt;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div align="center"><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5690075263795200"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EwIc141UUAUnA7x.png" width="650" alt="google-summer-of-code"/></a><br/><b><p>Automatically generate documentation out of React/React Native Component</p></b></div><p>This summer, I was pleased to get selected for Google Summer of Code&#x27;21 under the organization <a href="https://github.com/react-native-elements">React Native Elements</a>. Working under the organization, my project was to <strong>generate documentation automatically out of the UI components and present it in the Docusaurus website</strong>.</p><div align="center"><p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZcKASxMYMKA9SQnhIl/giphy.gif" alt="enter image description here"/></p></div><p>The purpose of creating this repository is to maintain a report summary of my GSoC work and this may also serve as a guide for future GSoC aspirants and a reference to the developers and contributors to the project.</p><h2>📙 Abstract</h2><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-elements">React Native Elements</a> is a cross-platform UI toolkit built on/for React Native. With a weekly download by 90k+ users and backed by a huge community, it provides UI components that can be used in your native application for the platform of Android/iOS/Web.</p><p>The documentation of the project was maintained manually previously i.e., suppose I want to change/add/remove a prop or a new component to the project the markdown file had to be changed manually. The process is tiring and new contributors may often forget to do so. So, during the summers I took the change this process and make a workflow such that the generation is automatic. This should be <strong>fast and maintainable</strong>.</p><h2>📝 Deliverables</h2><p>The deliverables of the project are as follows:</p><ul class="contains-task-list"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled=""/> <!-- -->Efficient Development Setup</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled=""/> <!-- -->Re-structure and Refactor code to have a common pattern.</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled=""/> <!-- -->Maintain the Usage/Examples of the component as they are needed to be updated manually.</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled=""/> <!-- -->Refactor and rename the directory structure such that Autogen is successful.<ul><li>Convert the code-base to have all the functional components.</li></ul></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled=""/> <!-- -->Commenting on all the components and props.<ul><li>Adding descriptions.</li><li>Adding prop descriptions.</li><li>Ensuring a common pattern is followed.</li></ul></li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled=""/> <!-- -->Writing <strong>scripts to extract data out</strong>(in JS/TS) of it in the form of JSON.</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" checked="" disabled=""/> <!-- -->Converting the JSON data to Markdown.</li><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""/> <!-- -->Automating the process such that the workflow works automatically whenever there is a change in the prop/definition or component code.</li></ul><p>All of the listed deliverables were completed within the GSoC period. 🎉</p><h2>📦 Working product</h2><p>The work can be found here - <a href="https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/next/">Official Website of React native elements</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[This is a guide to generate documentation of the UI components automatically.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is a guide to generate documentation of the UI components automatically.</p></blockquote><p>Initially when this workflow was not present, the entire documentation of the website was done by editing the docs manually by going to the <code>docs</code> directory under <code>website</code> and editing the markdown manually. Now, we have come with a flow where developers and contributors can focus more on logic than on writing markdown.</p><h2>Workflow</h2><p>To do this we have created scripts which would parse the components and generate documentation out of it.</p><p>This is a 2 step process:</p><ol><li><p>We take use of <code>react-docgen-typescript</code> which takes the input of the files for which we want to generate the documentation automatically. This gives in JSON as output. This JSON consists of all the details of the props including <code>type</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>description</code> and <code>defaultValue</code> and well as <code>description</code> of the components.</p></li><li><p>As we use Docusaurus for our documentation website, the pages of the documentation should be in the format of Markdown. Therefore, there should be process where we can change the JSON data, which we get from <code>react-docgen-typescript</code> to a suitable Markdown format. For this we use, <code>json2md</code> which takes in the data and convert it to suitable markdown string. This is stored in the directory and is shown on the website.</p></li></ol><h4>How does this work</h4><p>Well to make the script to work automatically what we have done is as follows:</p><ol><li><p>When you push your changes to your branch. A script <code>updateDocumentation.js</code> runs.</p></li><li><p>This invokes the <code>yarn docs:build</code> command which calls the scripts of auto-generation of docs and this also <em>lints</em> the markdown files generated at the same time.</p></li><li><p>Now, if there is any changes in the markdown files. A commit with message <code>Update Documentation</code> is done and pushed after your commit is done to the branch.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> By passing pre-push hook will result in failure of documentation update and may lead maintainers to close your PR.</p><h2>Updating existing components</h2><p>This is simple. Adding, removing, updating the props is also simple now. You just need to update the comments/description of the component and deal with the logic of your React Components(if required). Our workflow will automatically detect the markdown changes if any and push the changes using <code>pre-push</code> hooks while you push your code to your branch.</p><h2>Adding new components</h2><p>Trust me this is easy. We have designed the workflow such that, you only need to work on your JavaScript/TypeScript logic, without bothering about updating the markdown files. The input to the docgenParser is automatic and doesn&#x27;t require any aditional cofiguration.</p><p><strong>Make sure to add appropriate comments and description related to the components and the props of the component. Try keeping your code simple with simpler types for Autogen to work.</strong></p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> The file name of the component as well as the folder must be in Capital letter. We use <code>regex</code> to parse the file paths, so this is important.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If there are complex types/defaultValue, please head to <code>website/scripts/docgen/docgenParser.ts</code> to deal with those cases. Although we recommend you to avoid it as far as possible. Try improving the React logic and that will work.</p><h2>How to add a new demo for the component?</h2><p>The demos can now be added by moving in to the <code>usage</code> directory under <code>website/docs/main</code> directory. We now have added Snack Player so that you get the glimpse of the component and also get to know how it works. Under the <code>usage</code>, there is a separate folder for each UI Component, where you can add Usage related to component and relevant descriptions.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: To add Snack demo, add it inside the snack directory. You can add as many Snack which will make our repository more helpful for developers.</p><h2>Testing the changes</h2><p>For testing the changes in the documentation autogeneration, we simply need to run the following commands in sequence.</p><pre><code class="language-bash">cd website
yarn test
</code></pre><p>We have also included the changes in the main test process, so this will automatically run with the workflow as well as when you run the <code>yarn test</code> command from root of the project.</p><h2>Future</h2><p>Some of the components are class-based. They are: Input, SearchBar, Rating.(from <a href="https://github.com/Monte9/react-native-ratings">https://github.com/Monte9/react-native-ratings</a>). If you change the components to Functional/hooks based please remove it from the array of <code>filesToExclude</code> under <code>website/scripts/docgen/getComponentFiles.ts</code>. These are the paths of the component files for which the process is still manual.</p><p>So, generating the documentation doesn&#x27;t come up well for these components. Due to the existing structure <code>react-docgen-typescript</code> fails to generate relevant result for them. We are therefore looking for contributions on these components to make them Fuctional/Hooks based.</p><p>Thanks. Hope you like the new workflow. Looking forward for improvements and contributions to it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have been a lot of changes and improvements coming through the pipeline recently with <code>react-native-elements</code>. So in preparing for a version 3, there are some planned deprecations that will be added into version 2.3 and then removed in version 3.</p><p>The reason for these changes is that <code>react-native-elements</code> regularly gets requests for new features and enhancements quite frequently. The fast and easy method of adding these new features is usually to add another prop into the component that then injects some change into a child component. Unfortunately, this ends up leading to the components having a lot of props, lots of conditional code, and additional code complexity. The solution going forward and into version 3 will be to break down large components into smaller pieces so that it is easier to inject your own code without having to wait for an additional prop to be added.</p><p>As we continue to build up to version 3, this post will continue to be updated with new step-by-step directions on how to upgrade your code to work around these changes. The RNE team thanks you for your patience, and we hope that you see the value in the upcoming changes.</p><h2>Avatar</h2><p><code>accessory</code>, <code>showAccessory</code>, and <code>accessoryProps</code> are all being dprecated. There is now a child component <code>Avatar.Accessory</code> that you insert as a child component instead.</p><pre><code class="language-js">&lt;Avatar&gt;
  &lt;Avatar.Accessory {...accessoryProps} /&gt;
&lt;/Avatar&gt;
</code></pre><h2>ListItem</h2><p><code>ListItem</code> has a large number of deprecated props. <code>ListItem</code> has been somewhat of a kitchen sink. All the props can be replaced by inserting them as children in the order of left to right as they appear on the screen.</p><h3>leftElement, leftIcon, leftAvatar, rightElement, rightIcon, rightAvatar</h3><p>These can be replaced by using <code>Text</code>, <code>Icon</code>, and <code>Avatar</code> components respectively.</p><h3>title, titleStyle, titleProps, subtitle, subtitleProps, subtitleStyle</h3><p>These props can be replaced by <code>ListItem.Content</code>, <code>ListItem.Title</code> and <code>ListItem.Subtitle</code></p><pre><code class="language-js">&lt;ListItem&gt;
  &lt;ListItem.Content&gt;
    &lt;ListItem.Title style={titleStyle} {...titleProps}&gt;
      {title}
    &lt;/ListItem.Title&gt;
  &lt;/ListItem.Content&gt;
&lt;/ListItem&gt;
</code></pre><h3>contentContainerStyle, rightContentContainerStyle</h3><p>These props should be placed in the <code>style</code> prop of <code>ListItem.Content</code>.</p><h3>rightTitle, rightTitleStyle, rightTitleProps, rightSubtitle, rightSubtitleStyle, rightSubtitleProps</h3><p>These props also use <code>ListItem.Content</code>, <code>ListItem.Title</code>, and <code>ListItem.Subtitle</code>. Simply add the prop <code>right</code> to each one.</p><pre><code class="language-js">&lt;ListItem&gt;
  &lt;ListItem.Content right&gt;
    &lt;ListItem.Title right style={titleStyle} {...titleProps}&gt;
      {title}
    &lt;/ListItem.Title&gt;
