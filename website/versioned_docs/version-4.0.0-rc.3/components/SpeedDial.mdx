When pressed, a floating action button can display three to six related actions in the form of a speed dial.
If more than six actions are needed, something other than a FAB should be used to present them.
Upon press, the FAB remains visible and emits a stack of related actions.
If the FAB is tapped in this state, it should either initiate its default action or close the speed dial actions.
