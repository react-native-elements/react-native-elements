Switch represents user's decision of a process and indicates whether a state is on/off.
Switch is a controlled component that requires an `onValueChange` to update the `value` prop.
This renders a `boolean` value. React native elements provide you with additional `theme` and `color` support in the Switch Button.
This component inherits [all native Switch props that come with a standard React Native Switch element](https://reactnative.dev/docs/switch.html).
